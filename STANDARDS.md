## Triaging and Labeling Issues

We have a core set of labels. These labels are not exhaustive but make up
a convention for available labels across all Product Delivery projects.

* Problem Identifications: `bug`, `security`

  * Identifies the type of fix required.
  * Color code: ![#b60205](https://placehold.it/15/b60205/000000?text=+) `#b60205`

* Enhancement identifications: `improvement`, `documentation`, `fix`, `new-feature`

  * Identifies: pull requests, feature requests
  * Color code: ![#0e8a16](https://placehold.it/15/0e8a16/000000?text=+) `#0e8a16`

* Request for comments: `question`, `proposal`, `support-request`

  * Proposing new features/changes or requesting info / support
  * Used to capture conversations and decisions. Pull requests should have a “closes #<issue>” which would link the proposal.
  * Color code: ![#1d76db](https://placehold.it/15/1d76db/000000?text=+) `#1d76db`

* `<components/misc labels>`

  * Use for components, miscellaneous type labels as needed by the project

## Directly Responsible Individual ("DRI")

Read the [primer about Apple's DRI model](https://www.quora.com/Apple-company/How-well-does-Apples-Directly-Responsible-Individual-DRI-model-work-in-practice).

The Directly Responsible Individual model is a simple model to clarify
communications and accountability. We use GitHub's assignee as the
DRI for the issue.

### Expectations of a DRI for a project:

* Make pragmatic decisions (priorities, ship dates, etc)
* Ensure all issues are triaged
* Prioritize issues appropriately with labels, projects, milestones, etc.
* Assign issues to DRI on Issues (delegate)
* Remove project level blockers (resourcing, miscommunication, etc)

### Expectations of an DRI for an issue:

* Drive the issue to a **closed** state. (fixed or wontfix).
* Unblocking the issue
* Work on or delegate tasks to complete the issue
* Keep the issue's status in a project current (backlog, in progress, blocked,
  etc)
